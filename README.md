# Sunland test task



Create a simple login application coded in Symfony (PHP) and a javascript frontend could be Vue, React, Vanilla Js or others.

### The applications requirements are as follows:
- Needs a login to access the pages.
- token or cookie needs to be saved so user doesn’t have to login at every reload.
- token or cookie needs to be validated by the backend on every reload.
- user should be redirected away from pages if the token or cookie has expired.

Make the application appearance as simple as possible design wise (don’t waste time on making it look nice), and focus on the backend code and the interaction between the js and the php backend.
